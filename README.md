# The-Name-Game
Assigns synonyms with same first letter as inputed name.

The Name Game is meant for groups of people trying to break the ice and get to know each other.
The 'monitor' of the scores will input someone's name and the individual will have to repeat it with the synonym that
was outputted (ex: Jolly Jerry)
Each new player will have to repeat everyones names and their own and if they remember then itll be the next player's turn and 
the team will gain a point.
The team loses when a player fails to remember someones name and/or the assigned synonym. When this happens, the monitor should
now click the "get score' button which will reset the board and ask for a new team name.
The three teams with the highest score will be added to the highscore board :)
